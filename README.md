Task 4 of Machine Learning at Prodigy Infotech

## Task: To develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.
We have used various CNN techniques and visualisations to make sure that our machine carries out hand gesture detections as accurately as possible.
